Congratulations on tackling Chaos level 4!

As mentioned in the last section, passing level 4 also requires that the service:

- can still operate with the failure of one dependency
- reports metrics, traces, and logs
- monitoring fully covers latency, errors, traffic, and saturation (aka The 4 Golden Signals)

So it looks like the MetricsPuppy development team has some work to do! Remember to file tickets or make tasks after your experiments to ensure this work gets done.
