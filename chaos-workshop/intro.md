# Hands-on introduction to Chaos Engineering


In this workshop, we'll learn the fundamentals of chaos engineering by running a few chaos experiements.

To start, we'll examine a small, microservices-based application running in Kubernetes by looking at the architecture and examining the baseline performance in Datadog.

For the first experiment, we'll increase the CPU load and validate our experiment in monitoring.

In the second experiment, we'll ???

The third experiment will ???

By the end of the workshop, you'll have the knowledge and experience to begin implementing chaos experiments in your own environments.
