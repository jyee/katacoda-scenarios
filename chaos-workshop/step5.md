Congrats on passing Chaos Level 1!

For our next experiment...

Remember to plan your experiment. Start a new [Datadog Notebook](https://app.datadoghq.com/notebook) and write up a plan with your SRE partner:

1. Schedule it.
1. Pick tests.
1. Make a hypothesis.
1. Have a backup plan.
1. Share!

After you have a plan in place, let's pause briefly to discuss with the entire group.
