Congrats on passing Chaos Level 1!

Chaos Level 2 involves testing your application by blocking dependencies. Memebook is dependent on three services:

- `lolcat` translates the text into lolcat.
- `doggo` uses an external api to get a dog photo.
- `redis` is used to store the updated entry.

With your partner, discuss which dependency you'd like to disrupt, how you plan to do it, and what results you expect to see in the application and in Datadog.

In a few minutes we'll pause and share your plans with the larger group.

After you've shared with the larger group, write your plan in a new [Datadog Notebook](https://app.datadoghq.com/notebook).

1. Schedule it.
1. Pick tests.
1. Make a hypothesis.
1. Have a backup plan.
1. Share!

Once you have a plan in place, run your experiment with your partner.
