Congrats on passing Chaos Level 1!

For our next experiment, let's test our dependencies. Memebook is dependent on three services:

- `lolcat` translates the text into lolcat.
- `doggo` uses an external api to get a dog photo.
- `redis` is used to store the updated entry.

With your partner, select a service to disrupt and write your plan in a new [Datadog Notebook](https://app.datadoghq.com/notebook).

1. Schedule it.
1. Pick tests.
1. Make a hypothesis.
1. Have a backup plan.
1. Share!

After you have a plan in place, let's pause briefly to discuss with the entire group.
